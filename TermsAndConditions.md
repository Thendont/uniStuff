# Terms & conditions for the subjugation of your peoples
## 1. Your peoples must have something I require or need
If your people aren't in the possession of items/resources of value to me, I won't bother using my iron fist to crush your hopes and dreams and subsequently rule you.
## 2. Your leader must be in opposition of my rule
I cannot begin a crusade to dominate over your civilisation if your leader supports me, that would be e fighting myself
